Data-oriented entity management system on NES

Big thanks to @clearvus YouTube archive of a stream he did 7 years ago. I learn best by walking through at pace with someone, even if they make a few mistakes along the way. Perhaps because of it. Witnessing the logic of working through assembly code and not the polished final product of a tutorial was very helpful for me.

After video 5 he gets basic collision detection running, then talks about wanting to do a more data-oriented version. At this point I paused my progress because I was already wondering if there was a better data-oriented approach to his entire entity management system (which was very helpful for me to understand OOP-type structures in assembly). So with no further knowledge or research, and knowing naught but the barest concept of what data-oriented design even is, I tried my hand at a data-oriented entity management system on NES, with the aim to see how hard I can tax the machine.

I'm starting with three 64 byte arrays for entity type, x position and y position. 

Anyways, we'll see if it works.
